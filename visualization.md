## Scalable, general-purpose 3D tools

* [ParaView full-day slides](https://westgrid.github.io/trainingMaterials/materials/paraviewWorkshop.pdf) (128
  pages, last updated December 2019)
  - introduction to sci-vis • ParaView architecture and GUI • importing data • filters • exporting
    scenes (need to add Cinema) • Animation • Scripting • Remote visualization on CC clusters • more
    advanced topics in webinars

* [VisIt full-day slides](https://westgrid.github.io/trainingMaterials/materials/visitWorkshop.pdf) (129 pages,
    last updated May 2017)
  - introduction to sci-vis • VisIt architecture and GUI • importing data • operators • quantitative
    analysis • more controls: professional quality plots and animation • scripting • remote visualization
    on CC clusters • more advanced topics in webinars

* DHSI "3D visualization for the humanities" workshop

## Other tools

* 3D tools: VMD, VTK
* Volumetric plotting and analysis: yt
* Plotting: Plotly, Bokeh, Matplotlib, Gephi, Gnuplot, Xmgrace

## Future training

* Future training: Cinema databases, VTK-m, TTK (The Topology ToolKit), VTK.js and other web-based
  visualization (May-13 webinar)

## Remote visualization on Compute Canada systems

- large-scale rendering workshops: included in ParaView slides, datasets, much prefer CPU rendering
- prefer client-server or batch visualization, no fans of X11 forwarding and VNC (if client-server available)
